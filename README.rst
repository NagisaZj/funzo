What about the name?
----------------------
**funzo** is a Swahili word for instruction or doctrine or simply teaching, which is what we try to achieve here using IRL. If we do not succeed, the end result may not be desirable as Homer Simpson found out with `Homers funzo <http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Funzo>`__
