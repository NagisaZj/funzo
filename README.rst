funzo
============
Python toolkit for inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Documentation: https://funzo.readthedocs.org

Features
---------
* Flexible interfaces allowing easy extensions
* Inverse Reinforcement Learning
    - Bayesian IRL (including TBIRL for finite and infinite domains)
* RL Domains
    - GridWorld (discrete)
    - PuddleWorld (continuous)
    - Social Navigation (continuous)
* MDP solvers
    - Exact methods, PI, VI


Example
------------
See `examples <examples>`_ folder.


What about the name?
----------------------
**funzo** is a Swahili word for instruction or doctrine or simply teaching, which is what we try to achieve here using IRL. If we do not succeed, the end result may not be desirable as Homer Simpson found out with `Homers funzo <http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Funzo>`__
